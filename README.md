# DoubleFluxVentilation
A DIY ventilation for small houses

Hy Guys,
this is the file to make a DIY double flux ventilation for ventilate, reduce heat loss from ventilation and sanitize your house.
You will find the tutorial to make it (in french) here: http://lowtechlab.org/wiki/Double_Flux_pour_habitat_l%C3%A9ger_ou_mobile

The motor represents the ventilators. you have the electric scheme, the Frintzing plan (the same but more user friendly and the arduino code)
Logically it works on Arduino Uno but the code is so simple that it can likely works on nano or mega. If somebody test it, please comment!
